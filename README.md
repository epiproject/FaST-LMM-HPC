	You can run the next command line:
 
    $ mpirun -np <num_MPI_procs> -host <hosts> python mpi_manager.py <num_python_procs> <epiDataset> <epiPheno>
 	
    $ mpirun -np 4 -hosts host0,host1,host2,host0 python mpi_manager.py 8 epiData epiPheno.pheno

  The results are stored in "dataframe.out" binary file. If you want to read it, you need make a script for that.
  You can see in the path an example of script "output_read.py" for read the output file. This script store the dataframe generated by the application
