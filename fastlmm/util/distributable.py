'''
A distributable job is a map/reduce (aka scatter/rather aka split/tabulate) job defined by a class that implements the
IDistributable interface (which Python doesn't check). FastLmmSet is an example of an distributable job.
Such distributable jobs can by run by IRunners.

See SamplePi.py for examples.
